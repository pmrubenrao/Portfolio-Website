      <h1>I am Back-end developer</h1>
      <p>
        HI! My name is Ruben and I’ve been working as a backend developer for
        over 6 years. I do expose myself to the realm of frontend development in
        my projects to move towards my goal of becoming a Full Stack Developer.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I first entered into the frontend development I get overwhelmed
        with the variety of the framework that is available to work on. But, I
        got influenced by a documentary from
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrxmtDw4pVI/">Honey-Pot</a>
        about the frontend framework Vue.js and I fall for it. I google the best
        available course on Udemy and started learning and build few projects on
        it.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am a strong believer in the
        <strong>“giving back to the community” </strong>concept. All the things
        you learn from your life experiences should be shared with your
        community and the best way to do it is by logging your experiences in
        form of a blog or use famous sites like medium or StackOverflow, which
        also builds a good online presence that showcases your work and efforts.
        <br />
        <br />
        In my free time, I love playing famous song arpeggios on guitar, you can
        watch those on my
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ruben_rao/">Instagram</a> profile.
