      <h1>I am Back-end developer</h1>
      <p>
        HI! My name is Ruben and Iâ€™ve been working as a backend developer for
        over 6 years. I do expose myself to the realm of frontend development in
        my projects to move towards my goal of becoming a Full Stack Developer.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I first entered into the frontend development I get overwhelmed
        with the variety of the framework that is available to work on. But, I
        got influenced by a documentary from a
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrxmtDw4pVI/">Honey-Pot</a>
        about the frontend framework Vue.js and I fall for it. I google the best
        available course on Udemy and started learning it and build few projects
        on it
        <br />
        <br />
        It's really good to practice logging your experiences in form of a blog
        which helps the community to gain knowledge from your experiences and
        also builds a good online presence that showcases your work.
        <br />

        In my free time, I love playing famous song arpeggios on my guitar, you
        can find it on my
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ruben_rao/">Instagram</a> profile.
